This is a chaos machine that can be built using SuperCollider and the tutorial that goes along with this material can be found on YouTube at:

- The first scd file ("chaos array calculations") is where the actual calculations for the chaos machine are located.  Open this first and execute the code.  - Next, I would suggest opening the SynthDef file ("chaos composition SynthDef.scd") and executing that file so you add the SynthDefths to your server.  
- Next, open the Pbinds ("chaos composition pBind.scd") and execute that file.  These are the patterns that you will be using in the actual composition.
- Finally, open the Ppar file ("chaos Comp Ppar.scd") and you can run this file to actually hear the chaos machine.

This is a really pretty basic example, but I think there are lots of ways this could be very interesting.
